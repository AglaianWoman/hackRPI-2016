Juice Jacking / Automatic Android Rooting based on Intel Edison

A hardware-based Dirty-c0w implementation based on Juice Jackers. Originally intended to surprise users and inform them to their potential vulnerabilities, it branched more into an automatic Android rooting machine. Based on @timwr's Dirty Cow PoC. Automatically detects chipset and sends the appropriate payload to the device. Can be used to execute arbitrary code in an elevated environment. 
Relatively close to automatically handelling android Root Managers. 

Has a cool LCD display!

Most of the work was spent on deploying it on an Intel Edison board.
